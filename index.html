	     <h2>Baseball</h2>
		 <p>I like to play Baseball and its a fun sport that all people can play even if they don't know how to play. Baseball is my sport because I love to play it with my friends when we don't have games or its just fun to play against them and beat their team. The best part about Baseball is that you can have a great time playing and that Baseball isn't very competitive.</p>
		 
		 <h2>Fix Things</h2>
		 <p>I like to fix things because you get to find out how to make things from other stuff that you took apart, and then make things that will be better than the last thing that you had or made before that. The taking apart things are good because your mind will learn new things that you could use later on in life so it could help you out and you can make things that you like to your welcome.</p>
		 
		 <h2>Sleeping</h2> 
		 <p> I like to sleep because you get the rest that you need and that you grow so you need lots of sleep to help your body have the energy that you need. The sleep is the best part because you can help your body grow or you can just be lazy and do nothing because I do that sometimes when I don't want to wake up. The body needs sleep and that if you don't get any then you wont have a healthy and good growing body.
